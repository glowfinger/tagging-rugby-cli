## Codebase Patterns
- Use `CGO_ENABLED=0` for all Go build/vet commands (required for modernc.org/sqlite)
- Go binary is at `/home/node/go/bin/go` - use `export PATH="$PATH:/home/node/go/bin"` before Go commands
- Database connection uses modernc.org/sqlite (pure Go implementation, no CGO)
- Add new table migrations to the `migrate()` function in db/db.go - always use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
- Bubble Tea key strings: use "esc" (not "escape"), "enter", "tab", "backspace", "left", "right" for key handling
- SQL queries live in `db/sql/*.sql` files, embedded via `go:embed` in `db/queries.go` — reference as `db.InsertNoteSQL` etc.
- go:embed can only access files within the same package directory or subdirectories (no `../` paths)
- Three-column TUI layout uses padToWidth helper + manual row-by-row assembly (split lines, pad, join with border chars)
- lipgloss.Width() accounts for ANSI escape sequences when measuring rendered string width
- Column 3 live stats use loadTackleStatsForPanel() on tick — only updates when stats view is not active to avoid conflicts
- Go structs for all tables in db/models.go; database functions (insert/select/delete) in db/functions.go
- Use `db.InsertNoteWithChildren(database, category, db.NoteChildren{...})` for transactional insert of note + child records
- CLI commands create notes with category field ("clip", "tackle", or user-provided) plus child rows for timing, video, and type-specific data
- TUI note/tackle/clip creation also uses `db.InsertNoteWithChildren()` — same pattern as CLI commands
- Tackle stats in TUI use inline SQL queries joining note_tackles, notes, note_videos, and note_highlights (not embedded SQL files)
- loadNotesAndTackles() uses inline SQL joining notes, note_videos, note_timing, then loads child details/tackles/highlights per note
- Star highlights are stored as note_highlights rows with type="star", not as a column on notes
- huh forms package lives in tui/forms/ — theme, note form, and tackle form go here
- huh form integration pattern: store *huh.Form + result struct in Model, delegate Update/View, check State for completion
- huh forms need ALL message types delegated (not just KeyMsg) — cursor blink, focus msgs are internal
- huh Select auto-sets value to first option on Init() — exclude from HasData() checks for "empty form" detection
- Confirm discard pattern: intercept StateAborted, check HasData(), show confirm form, reopen original form if user cancels
- Normal-mode keybindings in Update() switch: msg.String() returns "left", "right", "up", "down" for arrow keys and "," "." for punctuation
- Command mode already handles "left"/"right" for cursor movement — normal-mode arrow cases only fire when commandInput.Active is false
- Column 1 renderColumn1() now uses GetControlGroups() from controls.go (single source of truth) — ControlGroup uses SubGroups [][]Control for divider placement
- padToWidth() uses lipgloss.Width() to ANSI-aware pad AND truncate lines to exact column width
- truncateToWidth() preserves ANSI escape sequences while trimming visible width
- normalizeLines() ensures column line arrays are exactly the target height
- Responsive layout: col3HideThreshold=90, col3MinWidth=18; at <90 cols, two-column layout with single border
- Arrow keys ("left","right","up","down") and punctuation (",",".") added as alternatives in normal-mode switch
- Use `ansi.Truncate()` from `charmbracelet/x/ansi` for ANSI+grapheme-aware truncation (handles emoji/wide chars)
- Shared time formatting lives in `pkg/timeutil/timeutil.go` — use `timeutil.FormatTime(seconds)` everywhere instead of inline formatting
- Shared time parsing lives in `pkg/timeutil/timeutil.go` — use `timeutil.ParseTimeToSeconds(str)` for HH:MM:SS, MM:SS, or raw seconds
- Bordered control boxes: use `components.RenderControlBox(group, width)` — renders tab header + box-drawing border + horizontal dividers between sub-groups

## 2026-02-10 - US-071
- Updated `formatTimeString()` in tui/tui.go from `%d:%02d` (M:SS) to `%d:%02d:%02d` (H:MM:SS)
- Updated `formatTime()` in tui/components/statusbar.go from `%02d:%02d` (MM:SS) to `%d:%02d:%02d` (H:MM:SS)
- Both functions now produce identical output for the same input
- Files changed: tui/tui.go, tui/components/statusbar.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Both formatTimeString (tui.go) and formatTime (statusbar.go) had slightly different format strings (%d vs %02d for minutes) — now unified to `%d:%02d:%02d`
  - The hour component uses `totalSeconds / 3600`, minutes use `(totalSeconds % 3600) / 60`
---

## 2026-02-10 - US-072
- Created `pkg/timeutil/timeutil.go` with shared `FormatTime(seconds float64) string` function
- Replaced all inline `int(x)/60`, `int(x)%60`, `%d:%02d` patterns in CLI commands with `timeutil.FormatTime()`
- Updated `cmd/note.go` (noteAddCmd, noteListCmd, noteGotoCmd), `cmd/clip.go` (clipStartCmd, clipEndCmd, clipListCmd, clipPlayCmd), `cmd/tackle.go` (tackleAddCmd, tackleListCmd), `cmd/root.go` (openCmd duration display)
- Replaced `formatTimeString()` in tui/tui.go and `formatTime()` in tui/components/statusbar.go with `timeutil.FormatTime()`
- Also updated tui/components/timeline.go and tui/components/noteslist.go to use the shared function
- Files changed: pkg/timeutil/timeutil.go (new), cmd/note.go, cmd/clip.go, cmd/root.go, cmd/tackle.go, tui/tui.go, tui/components/statusbar.go, tui/components/timeline.go, tui/components/noteslist.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The `formatTime` function was also used in timeline.go and noteslist.go (same components package) — check all usages within a package before removing a function
  - Using `replace_all` in Edit tool also replaces function definitions, not just calls — be careful with broad replacements
  - cmd/root.go also had inline time formatting (duration display in open command) — search broadly for patterns like `int(x)/60`
---

## 2026-02-10 - US-073
- Replaced inline MM:SS formatting in tackleform.go and noteform.go with `timeutil.FormatTime()`
- Both form headers now show H:MM:SS format (e.g. "Add Tackle @ 0:05:30", "Add Note @ 0:05:30")
- Increased notes list time column width from 8 to 9 chars to accommodate H:MM:SS format
- noteslist.go already used `timeutil.FormatTime()` from US-072, no change needed there
- Files changed: tui/forms/tackleform.go, tui/forms/noteform.go, tui/components/noteslist.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The forms package had its own inline time formatting separate from the components package — always search for `int(timestamp)`, `/ 60`, `% 60` patterns across all packages
  - noteslist.go time column was 8 chars wide which could truncate H:MM:SS for videos >= 10 hours — bumped to 9
---

## 2026-02-10 - US-074
- Added `ParseTimeToSeconds()` to `pkg/timeutil/timeutil.go` with colon-count based parsing: 2 colons = H:M:S, 1 colon = M:S, 0 colons = raw seconds
- Replaced local `parseTimeToSeconds()` in `tui/tui.go` with `timeutil.ParseTimeToSeconds()`
- Removed unused local `parseTimeToSeconds()` from `cmd/note.go` (was defined but never called)
- Updated seek error message to mention HH:MM:SS format
- Files changed: pkg/timeutil/timeutil.go, tui/tui.go, cmd/note.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The `parseTimeToSeconds()` in cmd/note.go was dead code — never called anywhere. Always check for actual call sites before assuming a function is in use
  - `strings.Count(timeStr, ":")` is a clean way to dispatch on time format rather than trying to parse each format sequentially
  - Consolidating parse + format in the same `pkg/timeutil` package keeps all time handling in one place
---

## 2026-02-10 - US-075
- Restructured `ControlGroup` to use `SubGroups [][]Control` instead of flat `Controls []Control`
- Removed `Emoji` field from `Control` struct — no longer used anywhere
- Reorganized into 3 groups: Playback (3 sub-groups: Play/Back/Fwd, Step-/Step+, Frame-/Frame+), Navigation (Prev/Next/Mute/Overlay), Views (Stats/Help/Quit)
- Updated `ControlsDisplay()` horizontal bar to iterate sub-groups, format as `Name [Shortcut]` without emojis
- Updated `renderColumn1()` in tui.go to iterate sub-groups with blank line separators between sub-groups
- Files changed: tui/components/controls.go, tui/tui.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The old 4-group structure (Playback, Navigation, Step/Overlay, Views) merged into 3 groups — Step controls moved into Playback as sub-group, Overlay moved to Navigation
  - `ControlsDisplay()` is used as a horizontal bar during forms — it also needed updating to iterate `SubGroups` instead of `Controls`
  - `renderColumn1()` directly iterated `group.Controls` — needed refactoring to use nested sub-group iteration
---

## 2026-02-10 - US-076
- Added `RenderControlBox(group ControlGroup, width int) string` to tui/components/controls.go
- Renders bordered box with tab-style header using box-drawing characters (┌┐└┘│─├┤)
- Tab header spans 3 lines: tab top, tab bracket with styled name, tab bottom extending to full width
- Horizontal dividers (├───┤) separate sub-groups within the box
- Control rows: name left-aligned, [ Shortcut ] right-aligned with proper padding
- Colors: borders=Purple, header=Pink, names=LightLavender, shortcuts=Cyan
- Uses ansi.Truncate() for safe width truncation
- Files changed: tui/components/controls.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The tab header design requires 3 lines: the tab top (offset by 1 space), the bracket line (┌┤ Name ├┐), and the connecting line (│└─┘└───┐) that ties the tab to the full-width box
  - Inner width = total width - 2 (for left and right border chars)
  - For the connecting line (line 3), remainW = innerW - tabInnerW - 3 accounts for the └, ┘, and └ characters between tab bottom and right extension
  - `lipgloss.Width()` is essential for measuring strings with ANSI escape codes when calculating padding
---

## 2026-02-10 - US-078
- Added `UpdateNoteWithChildren(db, noteID, children)` function to `db/functions.go` — deletes existing child rows (details, zones, highlights, tackles) and re-inserts from NoteChildren struct, all in a transaction
- Added `UpdateNoteTiming(db, noteID, start, end)` function to `db/functions.go` — updates the timing record for a given note, returns `sql.ErrNoRows` if no timing row exists
- Created SQL files: `delete_note_details.sql`, `delete_note_zones.sql`, `delete_note_highlights.sql`, `delete_note_tackles.sql`, `update_note_timing.sql`
- Added `go:embed` vars in `db/queries.go` for all new SQL files
- Files changed: db/functions.go, db/queries.go, db/sql/delete_note_details.sql (new), db/sql/delete_note_zones.sql (new), db/sql/delete_note_highlights.sql (new), db/sql/delete_note_tackles.sql (new), db/sql/update_note_timing.sql (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The delete-then-reinsert pattern is simpler than individual UPDATE statements for child tables since there can be varying numbers of child rows
  - `UpdateNoteTiming` uses positional args `(start, end, noteID)` matching the SQL `SET start=?, end=? WHERE note_id=?` — parameter order differs from InsertNoteTiming
  - The child tables all have ON DELETE CASCADE from notes, but for updating children without deleting the parent note, explicit DELETE per child table is needed
---

## 2026-02-10 - US-077
- Replaced flat controls list in renderColumn1() with bordered container boxes using RenderControlBox()
- Each of the 3 control groups (Playback, Navigation, Views) now renders as a bordered box with tab header
- Playback box shows 3 sub-groups separated by horizontal dividers matching wireframe/playback.txt
- Navigation and Views boxes show single sub-groups without internal dividers
- 1 blank line gap separates each bordered container
- Playback status card and Selected Tag detail card remain unchanged above controls
- ControlsDisplay() horizontal bar already correctly uses Name [Shortcut] format with no emojis (from US-075)
- Files changed: tui/tui.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The RenderControlBox() function from US-076 made this change very simple — just iterate groups and call it
  - The old renderColumn1() had ~30 lines of manual control rendering that collapsed to ~6 lines
  - No import changes needed since all the removed local styles (subHeaderStyle, shortcutStyle, nameStyle) were local variables, and their underlying packages (lipgloss, styles) were still used elsewhere in the function
