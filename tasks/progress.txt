# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `CGO_ENABLED=0` for all Go build/vet commands (modernc.org/sqlite requirement)
- Go binary at `/home/node/go/bin/go` — export PATH before commands
- huh forms live in `tui/forms/` — the old `tui/components/noteinput.go` and `tackleinput.go` are now deleted
- `openNoteInput()` and `openTackleInput()` in tui/tui.go are the huh-based methods, not references to old code
- Colour palette is Ciapre (warm/earthy) — constants kept as DeepPurple/DarkPurple/etc. for backward compat but values are Ciapre hex
- New colour constants available: `styles.Amber`, `styles.Red`, `styles.Green`

---

## 2026-02-09 - US-001
- Deleted deprecated `tui/components/noteinput.go` and `tui/components/tackleinput.go`
- Verified no remaining imports or references to `NoteInputState`, `TackleInputState`, `NoteInputField`, `TackleInputField` types
- Build and vet pass cleanly
- Files changed: tui/components/noteinput.go (deleted), tui/components/tackleinput.go (deleted)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The method names `openNoteInput` / `openTackleInput` in tui/tui.go are the huh form openers — don't confuse with the deleted deprecated types
  - `NoteInput` and `TackleInput` types were only self-contained in their own files with no external references, making deletion safe
---

## 2026-02-09 - US-002
- Replaced all 8 colour constants in `tui/styles/styles.go` with Ciapre palette hex values
- Added 3 new constants: Amber (#CC8B3F), Red (#AC3835), Green (#A6A75D)
- Updated Warning style to use Red, Success style to use Green
- Updated package doc string to reference Ciapre palette
- Build and vet pass cleanly
- Files changed: tui/styles/styles.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Kept original constant names (DeepPurple, DarkPurple, etc.) even though Ciapre isn't purple — avoids renaming across 20+ files
  - All components reference `styles.XXX` constants, so changing values in one place propagates everywhere
  - New Amber, Red, Green constants are available for US-003+ (sub-headers, warnings, success)
---

## 2026-02-09 - US-005
- Reordered `renderColumn1()` in `tui/tui.go` to render sections as: (1) Playback, (2) Selected Tag, (3) Controls
- Previously the order was Controls → Playback → Selected Tag
- Each section retains its styled header (Pink for Playback/Selected Tag, Cyan for Controls) with blank line separators
- Updated function comment to reflect new order
- Build and vet pass cleanly
- Files changed: tui/tui.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `renderColumn1()` starts around line 1569 — the three sections are self-contained blocks that can be reordered by moving code blocks
  - The Selected Tag section is conditional (only renders if an item is selected), so the blank line separator after it needs to be inside the `if item != nil` block
  - `ControlsDisplay()` in controls.go is a separate horizontal compact layout used for form overlay views — not the same as the column 1 controls rendering
---

## 2026-02-09 - US-006
- Added `Name` field to `ControlGroup` struct in `tui/components/controls.go`
- Updated `GetControlGroups()` with group labels: "Playback", "Navigation", "Step / Overlay", "Views"
- Redesigned controls section in `renderColumn1()` in `tui/tui.go`:
  - Each group gets an amber-styled sub-header (`styles.Amber`)
  - Each control renders as two lines: emoji+name, then indented [key] in blue (`styles.Cyan`)
  - Blank line between each control, extra blank line between groups
- Left `ControlsDisplay()` unchanged — it's the horizontal compact layout used for form overlay views
- Build and vet pass cleanly
- Files changed: tui/components/controls.go, tui/tui.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The `ControlGroup.Name` field is now available for any view that wants to display group labels
  - `ControlsDisplay()` is independent from the column 1 rendering — changes to one don't affect the other
  - Controls section clips naturally at column bottom since `renderColumn1` output is truncated to height by the column layout code

## 2026-02-09 - US-007
- Final QA verification — no code changes required
- Verified: `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./...` passes cleanly
- Verified: `CGO_ENABLED=0 go vet ./...` passes cleanly with no warnings
- Verified: No hardcoded hex colour values outside `tui/styles/styles.go` (all 11 colours defined centrally)
- Verified: No old palette values (#1a1a2e, #16213e, #4a347d, #7b2cbf, #c77dff, #e0aaff, #ff6b9d, #64dfdf) remain anywhere
- Verified: StatusBar, Timeline, and CommandInput all use `.Width(width)` with full terminal width — no gaps
- Files changed: tasks/prd.json (mark passes: true), tasks/progress.txt (this entry)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - All full-width components (StatusBar, Timeline, CommandInput) use lipgloss `.Width(width)` pattern — maintain this for future components
  - Colour centralisation via `styles.XXX` constants means a grep for `#[0-9a-fA-F]{6}` in tui/ .go files is a reliable QA check
  - The column layout properly accounts for border characters (usableWidth = m.width - borderCount) so rows + borders + full-width bars all align

## 2026-02-10 - US-097
- Replaced pictographic emojis in `tui/components/miniplayer.go`:
  - `🔇 Muted` → `MUTED` (line 47)
  - `⚠ Not connected` → `! Not connected` (line 53)
- Kept `▶` and `⏸` play/pause icons (simple Unicode symbols, not pictographic emojis)
- Mini player auto-sizing still works correctly — uses `lipgloss.Width()` which handles text widths properly
- Build and vet pass cleanly
- Files changed: tui/components/miniplayer.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Mini player uses `lipgloss.Width()` for auto-sizing, so changing emoji → text doesn't break layout
  - The `RenderMiniPlayer` function builds content lines then measures them for the card width — text replacement is straightforward
---

## 2026-02-10 - US-098
- Replaced medal emojis in `tui/components/statspanel.go` leaderboard:
  - `🥇` → `#1`, `🥈` → `#2`, `🥉` → `#3`
  - `" 4"` → `#4`, `" 5"` → `#5` (now consistent formatting across all ranks)
- Renamed `medalIcons` → `rankLabels` and `medal` → `rank` for clarity
- Bar graph `█` character kept unchanged (block element, not emoji)
- Column alignment preserved: all rank labels are 2 characters wide, same as the old medal emojis
- Build and vet pass cleanly
- Files changed: tui/components/statspanel.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Medal emojis have visual width 2 (emoji width), same as `#N` text — so column alignment is preserved automatically
  - The `nameWidth` calculation in the leaderboard accounts for rank(2) + total(4) + pct(6) + padding(6) = 18 chars subtracted from width
