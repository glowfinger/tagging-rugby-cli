# Ralph Progress Log
# Branch: ralph/tackle-stats-table
# Started: 2026-02-12

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `CGO_ENABLED=0` for all Go build/vet commands (modernc.org/sqlite requirement)
- Go binary at `/home/node/go/bin/go` — export PATH before commands
- Layout utilities in `tui/layout/` package (PadToWidth, NormalizeLines, Container, ComputeColumnWidths, JoinColumns)
- Column render methods in `tui/columns.go` (renderColumn1/2/3/4) — same package `tui`, methods on *Model
- Container guarantees exact Width x Height output — every renderColumn MUST wrap in Container
- StatsPanel in tui/components/statspanel.go — receives tackleStats []PlayerStats, items []ListItem, width, height int
- PlayerStats struct in tui/components/statsview.go — fields: Player, Total, Completed, Missed, Possible, Other, Starred, Percentage
- Styles: styles.Pink (headers), styles.LightLavender (primary text), styles.Cyan (info/totals), styles.Lavender (dim text), styles.Purple (borders)

## 2026-02-12 - US-001
- Replaced Top Players leaderboard with Tackle Stats table in statspanel.go
- Table has header row (Player, Tot, Comp, Miss, %) styled with Pink+Bold
- TOTAL row pinned after header (Cyan style) — sums all players, shows overall %
- All players displayed (no top-5 limit), sorted by total desc, name asc tiebreaker
- Player names truncated to fit available width, % shows "-" for zero tackles
- Empty state preserved ("No tackle data" in dim italic)
- Files changed: tui/components/statspanel.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The truncateStr helper already exists in statspanel.go — reuse it for name truncation
  - Column width math: reserve fixed space for numeric columns, give remainder to name
  - TOTAL row must come before player rows so Container truncation keeps it visible

## 2026-02-12 - US-002
- Updated TUI-ARCHITECTURE.md to reflect tackle stats table replacing leaderboard
- Three changes: directory structure comment, Column 3 rendering table row, StatsPanel component contract
- Files changed: tui/TUI-ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Architecture doc has three places referencing statspanel: directory tree comment, column rendering table, and component contracts section — update all three when changing statspanel functionality
