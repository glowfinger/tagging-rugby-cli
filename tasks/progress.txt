# Ralph Progress Log
# Branch: ralph/control-box-rounded
# Started: 2026-02-14

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `CGO_ENABLED=0` for all Go build/vet commands (modernc.org/sqlite requirement)
- Go binary at `/home/node/go/bin/go` — export PATH before commands
- RenderControlBox in tui/components/controls.go lines ~133-246 (function + wireframe comment)
- Only caller: renderColumn4 in tui/columns.go line ~117
- ansi import in controls.go only used by RenderControlBox (line 229) — remove when deleting function
- fmt import in controls.go also used by RenderVideoBox (line ~277) — keep
- tui/columns.go already imports: fmt, strings, lipgloss, styles, components — no new imports needed
- RenderInfoBox in same package (controls.go line ~84) — accessible from columns.go via components.RenderInfoBox
- Inner width for InfoBox content = width - 4 (2 border chars + 2 padding spaces)
- TUI-ARCHITECTURE.md references: line ~27 (directory structure), ~153 (RenderControlBox signature)

## 2026-02-14 - US-001
- Replaced RenderControlBox call with inline row building + RenderInfoBox in renderColumn4
- Files changed: tui/columns.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Main branch still uses RenderMiniPlayer (rename happened on separate branch) — don't assume prior branch changes are merged
  - RenderInfoBox handles padding/borders; content lines just need leading space for inner padding
  - No new imports needed in columns.go — lipgloss, styles, fmt, components already imported
---

## 2026-02-14 - US-002
- Deleted RenderControlBox function and wireframe comment from controls.go (lines 133-246)
- Removed `ansi` import (charmbracelet/x/ansi) — only used by RenderControlBox
- Files changed: tui/components/controls.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - grep shows references in docs/tasks/archives but those are fine — only Go source matters for compilation
  - The `fmt` import was preserved since RenderMiniPlayer still uses it
---

## 2026-02-14 - US-003
- Updated TUI-ARCHITECTURE.md: removed RenderControlBox from directory structure and Controls section
- Added note that control groups are rendered via RenderInfoBox in renderColumn4
- Files changed: tui/TUI-ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TUI-ARCHITECTURE.md has three relevant sections: directory structure (~line 27), Controls signatures (~line 153), and ControlGroup description
  - Keep ControlGroup struct description since it's still used by GetControlGroups and renderColumn4
