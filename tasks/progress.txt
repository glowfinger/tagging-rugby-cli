# Ralph Progress Log
# Branch: ralph/rounded-control-boxes
# Started: 2026-02-14

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `CGO_ENABLED=0` for all Go build/vet commands (modernc.org/sqlite requirement)
- Go binary at `/home/node/go/bin/go` — export PATH before commands
- ALWAYS use Container component — every renderColumn function MUST wrap output in layout.Container{Width, Height}.Render(content)
- InfoBox inner width = width - 4 (2 border + 2 padding)
- PadToWidth is the single source of truth for exact column line width
- Use ansi.Truncate() from charmbracelet/x/ansi for ANSI+grapheme-aware truncation
- RenderInfoBox has 4 params: (title, contentLines, width, focused) — focused=true uses Pink border
- RenderControlBox uses square tab-style header (┌┤├┐) — being deprecated in favor of RenderInfoBox

## 2026-02-14 - US-001
- Implemented ControlGroupLines helper in tui/components/controls.go
- Updated renderColumn4 in tui/columns.go to use RenderInfoBox with ControlGroupLines instead of RenderControlBox
- Files changed: tui/components/controls.go, tui/columns.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ControlGroupLines is exported (capital C) since it's called from columns.go in the tui package
  - Inner width for RenderInfoBox content = width - 4 (2 border + 2 padding)
  - Blank lines between sub-groups are just empty strings in the []string slice

## 2026-02-14 - US-002
- Added Deprecated doc comment to RenderControlBox pointing to RenderInfoBox + ControlGroupLines
- Verified no call sites remain (only definition and comment)
- Files changed: tui/components/controls.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - After removing call sites, grep to confirm zero remaining usages before marking deprecated

## 2026-02-14 - US-003
- Updated TUI-ARCHITECTURE.md: directory structure, column rendering table, controls section
- Files changed: tui/TUI-ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Architecture doc has 3 locations to update for component changes: directory structure, column table, component signatures section
