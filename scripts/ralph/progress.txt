## 2026-02-11 - US-001
- Implemented Ctrl+E keybinding for export clips in TUI
- Added `startExportClips()` stub method (placeholder for US-006 implementation)
- Added "Ctrl+E - Export player clips" to help overlay in Navigation group
- Updated MEMORY.md with export keybinding pattern
- Files changed: tui/tui.go, tui/components/help.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - "E" key is already taken by "Edit selected tackle" — used Ctrl+E instead
  - Normal mode keybindings are automatically guarded by form/command mode checks above the switch statement
  - Help overlay entries use `{key, desc}` struct literals in grouped slices in help.go
  - Mini player mode whitelist (line ~176) doesn't need export key since export isn't relevant at small widths
