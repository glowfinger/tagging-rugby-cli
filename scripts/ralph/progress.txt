## Codebase Patterns
- Build with `CGO_ENABLED=0` - this environment doesn't support CGO (no gcc -m64)
- Use `export PATH=$HOME/go/bin:$PATH` before running go commands - Go is installed in home directory
- Dependencies are added with `go get` and pruned by `go mod tidy` if not directly imported
- Run quality checks with `CGO_ENABLED=0 go vet ./...`

## 2026-01-26 - US-001
- What was implemented:
  - Go module initialized as github.com/user/tagging-rugby-cli
  - cobra dependency installed for CLI framework
  - main.go created with cobra root command
  - cmd/root.go with Execute(), root command, and version command
  - Root command shows help with app name and description
  - Version command prints "tagging-rugby-cli version 0.1.0"
- Files changed:
  - go.mod (new)
  - go.sum (new)
  - main.go (new)
  - cmd/root.go (new)
  - prd.json (added to track progress)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - This environment has no sudo access and CGO doesn't work (gcc -m64 error)
  - Go was installed to $HOME/go from tarball, need to add to PATH
  - modernc.org/sqlite is CGO-free SQLite but won't be in go.mod until imported
  - viper dependency will be added when configuration features are needed
