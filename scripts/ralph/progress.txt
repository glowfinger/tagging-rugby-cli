## 2026-02-11 - US-001
- Implemented Ctrl+E keybinding for export clips in TUI
- Added `startExportClips()` stub method (placeholder for US-006 implementation)
- Added "Ctrl+E - Export player clips" to help overlay in Navigation group
- Updated MEMORY.md with export keybinding pattern
- Files changed: tui/tui.go, tui/components/help.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - "E" key is already taken by "Edit selected tackle" — used Ctrl+E instead
  - Normal mode keybindings are automatically guarded by form/command mode checks above the switch statement
  - Help overlay entries use `{key, desc}` struct literals in grouped slices in help.go
  - Mini player mode whitelist (line ~176) doesn't need export key since export isn't relevant at small widths

## 2026-02-11 - US-002
- Created SQL query `select_tackles_for_export.sql` joining note_tackles, note_timing, note_videos
- Added `TackleClipData` struct to db/models.go
- Added `SelectTacklesForExport` function to db/functions.go
- Added embed directive to db/queries.go
- Files changed: db/sql/select_tackles_for_export.sql (new), db/models.go, db/queries.go, db/functions.go
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tackles store timing as note_timing.start = note_timing.end = video timestamp (both same value initially)
  - Video path filtering requires JOIN to note_videos table (path stored there, not on notes or tackles)
  - note_details JOIN not needed for export — player/timing is sufficient
  - Follow existing pattern: embed SQL in queries.go, function in functions.go, struct in models.go
